Topic Description
-----------------

Images and testimony from the battles of World War II have become documentary cornerstones for games set during those events, however, are these games, documentaries, or simulations, and what would be the difference? Examining the primary source material of journalistic and propagandistic production, and the primary material related to game production helps students trace the way new media documentation becomes digital media fiction.
