Topic Description
-----------------

On-line bulletin boards are a dominant text-based forum for knowledge sharing and the aggregation of communities of practice. This unit looks at one borderline instantiation of a bulletin board system, and the protest that board organized through a filter that asks what gets remembered and how are on-line identities composed.

Together, they present a bit of a sense of what BBSes were like when there were no alternatives. These short documents are of varying quality. Covers topics like trolling, phreaking, hacking, asynchronous chat, modems, baudrate, compression, files, script kiddies, ascii art, and everything else a kid with a 1200cps modem would care about. Good 1st-person background material for contemporary forums.)
